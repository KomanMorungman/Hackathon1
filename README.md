To classify land cover types using NDVI time-series data from satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) labels into one of {Water, Impervious, Farm, Forest, Grass, Orchard} using Logistic Regression model for multiclass. NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) measures vegetation health using satellite data. NDVI=((NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED)) where NIR=Near-infrared reflectance and RED=Red Reflectance. Here, the missing values have been imputed after some EDA analysis. Necessary data preprocessing according to datasets (training and testing) such as feature scaling and data encoding have been done. The model has been trained with the training dataset 'hacktrain.csv' and tested with dataset'hacktest.csv'. The model's accuracy for solving the problem has been examined.
